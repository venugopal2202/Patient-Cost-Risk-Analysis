It helps in analyzing trends and metrics specific to different geographical areas.\n* **Period:** This column indicates the time period (e.g., weekly, total) for which the data is aggregated. It allows for analysis based on different periods of data collection.\n* **Data_Period_start:** Denotes the start date of the specific data period. It helps in determining the exact duration of the reported figures.\n* **Data_Period_end:** This is the end date of the specific data period. Together with the start date, it defines the window during which the data was collected.\n* **Covid_Deaths:** The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the specified jurisdiction during the data period. This is a key metric for analyzing the severity of the pandemic in different regions.\n* **Total_Covid_Prct:** The percentage of total deaths that were caused by COVID-19. This percentage highlights the proportion of deaths directly related to the pandemic within each jurisdiction.\n* **Pct_Change_Weekly:** The week-over-week percentage change in COVID-related metrics, such as deaths or infection rates. It is crucial for identifying spikes or declines in the spread of COVID-19 over time.\n* **Pct_Diff_Weekly:** Represents the difference between percentage changes over consecutive weeks. This allows for analyzing the volatility or consistency of COVID-related trends.\n* **Crude_Covid_Rate:** This column provides the crude rate of COVID-19 deaths per a certain population size (e.g., per 100,000 people). It is used to compare the relative impact of COVID-19 across regions, accounting for population differences.\n* **aa_Covid_Rate:** The age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate, which factors in the age distribution of the population. This is important for making more accurate comparisons across regions with varying age demographics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Exploration\nLet's have look at the data;","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"SELECT column_name ,data_type\nFROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"|column_name|data_type|\n|-----------|---------|\n|Date_of_Datarecorded|date|\n|Residence_Jurisdiction|\tvarchar|\n|Period\t|varchar|\n|Data_Period_start|\tdate|\n|Data_Period_end|\tdate|\n|Covid_Deaths|\tint|\n|Total_Covid_Prct|\tfloat|\n|Pct_Change_Weekly|\tfloat|\n|Pct_Diff_Weekly|\tfloat|\n|Crude_Covid_Rate|\tfloat|\n|aa_Covid_Rate|\tfloat|","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"SELECT COUNT(*) AS Row_count\nFROM CovidP","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are 21952 responses.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Checking for the correct category in Group column for further analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#For 'TOTAL' Category\nSELECT \n    SUM(Covid_Deaths) as Total_deaths, \n    min(Data_Period_start) as Start_Date,\n    MAX(Data_Period_end) as End_Date\nFROM \n    CovidP\nWHERE\n    Period = 'Total'\n    \n#For 'Weekly' Category\nSELECT \n    SUM(Covid_Deaths) as Total_deaths, \n    min(Data_Period_start) as Start_Date,\n    MAX(Data_Period_end) as End_Date\nFROM \n    CovidP\nWHERE\n    Period = 'Weekly'\n    \n#For '3 month period' Category\nSELECT \n    SUM(Covid_Deaths) as Total_deaths, \n    min(Data_Period_start) as Start_Date,\n    MAX(Data_Period_end) as End_Date\nFROM \n    CovidP\nWHERE\n    Period = '3 month period'","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I've chosen weekly data for this analysis as it provides a properly distributed and consistent view of trends. \nIn contrast, the total data represents a cumulative sum of daily figures, which can inflate the analysis  and \nthe 3-month period covers only a 4-month range, making it less reliable for consistent comparison","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Cleaning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Checking for NULL values in each Column.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"SELECT \n    COUNT(*) AS Total_Records, \n    SUM(CASE WHEN Covid_deaths IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Null_Count\nFROM CovidP;\n\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) AS Total_Records, \n    SUM(CASE WHEN Pct_diff_weekly IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Null_Count\nFROM CovidP;\n\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) AS Total_Records, \n    SUM(CASE WHEN Pct_Change_Weekly IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Null_Count\nFROM CovidP;\n\nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) AS Total_Records, \n    SUM(CASE WHEN Crude_Covid_Rate IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Null_Count\nFROM CovidP;","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Output:**\n* There are 1,512 NULL counts in Covid_deaths & Total_Covid_prct column.\n* There are 12,728 NULL counts in Pct_diff_weekly column.\n* There are 13,299 NULL counts in Pct_Change_Weekly.\n* There are 2490 NULL counts in Crude_covid_rate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Treating the NULL values with 0 and mean according to their significance.

Jurisdiction with Highest COVID-19 Deaths for the Latest Period:** The jurisdiction with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths for the latest data period end date is **United States**. This indicates a significant impact of the pandemic in this region, with the highest death toll compared to others.\n\n**2. Week-over-Week Percentage Change in Crude COVID Rate:** The week-over-week percentage change in the crude COVID rate shows that **Michigan** experienced the highest rate of increase. The top 10 jurisdictions exhibit notable variations, with some regions showing a sharp rise in COVID-19 spread over time.\n\n**3. Top 5 Jurisdictions with the Highest Percentage Difference Between aa_COVID_Rate and Crude COVID Rate:** The top 5 jurisdictions with the highest percentage difference between the age-adjusted COVID rate and the crude COVID rate reveal significant demographic disparities in the pandemic's impact. These differences suggest that age distribution played a major role in mortality rates across these regions.\n\n**4. Average Weekly COVID Deaths per Jurisdiction (Last Four Periods):** The average number of weekly COVID deaths across jurisdictions shows a consistent trend in certain regions, with **United States** having the highest weekly death toll. This highlights persistent COVID-19 mortality in certain areas over the last four data periods.\n\n**5. Jurisdictions with Non-Zero COVID Deaths and No Missing Data:** The jurisdictions that reported non-zero COVID deaths and had no missing data provide a more reliable and comprehensive view of the pandemic's effect. This ensures data accuracy for further analysis and comparison.\n\n**6. Week-over-Week Change in Total COVID Death Percentage (Since March 2020):** The top 10 jurisdictions with the highest total COVID deaths show varied week-over-week percentage changes since March 1, 2020. Some regions have experienced more gradual increases, while others showed significant spikes during key pandemic waves.\n\n**7. Cumulative COVID Deaths by Jurisdiction:** The cumulative COVID deaths up to the latest data period indicate that **United States** continues to lead in total deaths, reflecting the long-term impact of COVID-19 in this region. This highlights areas that were hit hardest throughout the pandemic.\n\n**8. Top 10 Jurisdictions with Highest Percentage Increase in COVID Deaths (Previous Week):** **Michigan** had the highest percentage increase in COVID deaths from the previous week. This rise indicates an emerging hot spot in the pandemic, with rapid growth in mortality over a short period, demanding further attention to contain the spread.","metadata":{}}]}
