# Pandemic Mortality Trends: A Deep Dive into Provisional COVID-19 Death Data

IntroductionÂ¶
This dataset captures COVID-19 data across different regions, focusing on mortality rates and trends. The data includes key metrics such as COVID-related deaths, percentage of total deaths due to COVID, weekly percentage changes, and crude COVID rates. The data spans a defined period with start and end dates and is categorized by residence jurisdiction, with the "total" group aggregating data for various time periods.


In this project, I will analyze COVID-19 data to address the following questions:

Which jurisdiction had the highest COVID-19 deaths for the latest data period end date?
What is the week-over-week percentage change in the crude COVID rate for all jurisdictions and groups, and how do they rank. Retrieve the top 10 results.
Which are the top 5 jurisdictions with the highest percentage difference between aa_COVID_rate and the overall crude COVID rate for the latest data period end date?
What is the average number of COVID deaths per week for each jurisdiction residence and group, based on the latest four data period end dates?
Which jurisdictions had non-zero COVID deaths and no missing data for the latest data period end date?
How has the percentage of total deaths attributed to COVID changed weekly for the top 10 jurisdictions with the highest total COVID deaths, starting from March 1, 2020?
What are the cumulative COVID deaths for each jurisdiction up to the latest data period end date?
Which Top 10 jurisdictions experienced the highest percentage increase in COVID deaths from the previous week, and what were the actual death numbers for each week?
