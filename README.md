# üè• Patient Encounter Cost and Risk Analysis in Healthcare Systems
# üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying patients with frequent high-cost encounters, analyzing procedure costs, and evaluating financial risks due to payer coverage gaps. Leveraging SQL-based analysis and Power BI visualizations, the project aims to uncover insights to improve operational efficiency, patient care, and resource planning in healthcare organizations.

# üîç Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations face challenges in managing financial risks and costs due to:

Frequent High-Cost Encounters
Uncovered Costs by Payer Coverage
Trends in Procedure Costs and Diagnosis Correlations
The analysis uses SQL to identify patterns across 5 key tables:

Encounters
Patients
Procedures
Payers
Organizations
# ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies Used
* SQL: Data cleaning, querying, and analysis.
* Power BI: Interactive visualizations and dashboards.

# üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation (Cleaning and Loading)
The data preparation phase involved creating tables, loading data from CSV files, and cleaning fields to ensure data consistency.

### Tables created:  https://github.com/venugopal2202/project_02/blob/main/SQL/CREATING%20TABLE%20AND%20INJECTING%20DATA

+ Encounters: Stores patient encounter details including costs, codes, and descriptions.
+ Organizations: Contains information about healthcare organizations, locations, and addresses.
+ Patients: Includes patient demographics like gender, race, birthdate, and location.
+ Procedures: Captures information about medical procedures performed during encounters.
+ Payers: Contains details about payers and their coverage contributions.

# üìà Analysis
# 1. SQL Analysis
The following SQL queries were used to analyze patient encounter costs, financial risks, and procedure trends:

# 1.1 Evaluating Financial Risk by Encounter Outcome
+ Objective: This query identifies the ReasonCodes that lead to the highest financial risk by calculating the uncovered cost (total claim cost minus payer coverage) for each encounter outcome.
+ Explanation:
The query combines patient demographics with encounter details to compute the uncovered cost for each encounter.
It then aggregates the data to calculate the average uncovered cost, total uncovered cost, and the number of encounters for each ReasonCode and EncounterOutcome.

## 1.2 Identifying Patients with Frequent High-Cost Encounters
+ Objective: This query identifies patients who had more than 3 encounters in a year, where each encounter had a total claim cost above $10,000.
+ Explanation:
A CTE (HighCostEncounters) is used to calculate the total number of encounters and the sum of claim costs for each patient grouped by year.
The query filters for patients whose total encounters exceed 3 and sorts them by the number of encounters and total claim costs in descending order.

## 1.3 Identifying Risk Factors Based on Demographics
+ Objective: This query identifies the top 3 most frequent diagnosis codes (ReasonCodes) and analyzes their association with patient demographics such as gender, race, and ethnicity to understand which groups are most affected by high-cost encounters.
+ Explanation:
The query first determines the top 3 ReasonCodes with the most encounters.
It then calculates the average uncovered cost, total uncovered cost and number of encounters for each group segmented by gender, race, and ethnicity.

## 1.4 Analyzing Payer Contributions for Procedure Costs
+ Objective: This query analyzes payer contributions for the base cost of procedures and identifies any gaps between the total claim cost and the payer coverage.
+ Explanation:
The query calculates the total base cost, total claim cost and total payer coverage for each procedure (ProcedureCode and ProcedureDescription) grouped by PAYER.
It also computes the uncovered cost as the difference between total claim cost and total payer coverage.
The results are ordered by the highest uncovered costs to highlight significant financial gaps.

## 1.5 Analyzing Patient Encounter Duration
+ Objective: This query calculates the average encounter duration for each EncounterClass per organization, identifying encounters where the duration exceeds 24 hours.
+ Explanation:
The query calculates the duration of each encounter in hours by subtracting the START time from the STOP time.
It then calculates the average duration for each EncounterClass within each organization and counts the number of encounters that exceed 24 hours.

## 1.6 Identifying Patients with Multiple Procedures Across Encounters
+ Objective: This query identifies patients who had multiple procedures across different encounters with the same ReasonCode.
+ Explanation:
The query first calculates the distinct encounters and distinct procedures for each patient and ReasonCode.
It then filters the results to only include patients with more than one encounter (DistinctEncounters > 1), ensuring that the analysis focuses on repeated high-cost utilization patterns.
Finally, the patient details such as FIRST, LAST, GENDER, and BIRTHDATE are retrieved and the results are ordered by encounter frequency and total procedures.
