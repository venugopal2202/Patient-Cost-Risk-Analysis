# üè• Pandemic Mortality Trends: A Deep Dive into Provisional COVID-19 Death Data
# üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying patients with frequent high-cost encounters, analyzing procedure costs, and evaluating financial risks due to payer coverage gaps. Leveraging SQL-based analysis and Power BI visualizations, the project aims to uncover insights to improve operational efficiency, patient care, and resource planning in healthcare organizations.

# üîç Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations face challenges in managing financial risks and costs due to:

Frequent High-Cost Encounters
Uncovered Costs by Payer Coverage
Trends in Procedure Costs and Diagnosis Correlations
The analysis uses SQL to identify patterns across 5 key tables:

Encounters
Patients
Procedures
Payers
Organizations
# ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies Used
SQL: Data cleaning, querying, and analysis.

Power BI: Interactive visualizations and dashboards.

# üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation (Cleaning and Loading)
The data preparation phase involved creating tables, loading data from CSV files, and cleaning fields to ensure data consistency.

### Tables created:  https://github.com/venugopal2202/project_02/blob/main/SQL/CREATING%20TABLE%20AND%20INJECTING%20DATA

Encounters: Stores patient encounter details including costs, codes, and descriptions.
Organizations: Contains information about healthcare organizations, locations, and addresses.
Patients: Includes patient demographics like gender, race, birthdate, and location.
Procedures: Captures information about medical procedures performed during encounters.
